# byke-race-multiple
My first game in Java to excersise disigning objects and building interacting of them

By the second step I've created a possibility for a few members to take part in the race. I've introduced byker.time var to calculate the step passing time. Time is accumulated  with each next step. In the branch I put var "time" into Byker because it was calculated whole for all bykers in Race.
Lets move farther to multiple version.
