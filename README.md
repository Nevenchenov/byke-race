# byke-race
My first game in Java to excersise disigning objects and building interacting of them

By the first step I've created Byker (to game be able converce with), Byke (instrument to racing with. Some limits to add the element of unpredictablessness have been set, such as max byke velocity and maximum range of accelerating), designing fields and methods of them. I've caught the idea to inject a weather for additional advanture on the road. The Weather class have been included. Sun is neutral, rain is first and icy is second degry of influence on race flow. How to range a few racers on the trace and in time? It should be the same step of the loop with specific trace curvature but at now time moment all of racers have their own speed and pass discrepant trace segment. The problem is solved by passing race in trace spacing but not in time one. Any byker stay at the same site of the road at current step but each of them has different time of the segment passing. Winner has minimal time. Class Road was developed. This is array of randomly for each race generated set of road curvatures. The Road fealds are distance(longiness) and maxCurvature(which limits bend in the road radius). Class Main calculate time of road segments passing in loop. Just for single player for that stage. Testing&debugging completed. 
Lets move farther to multiple version.
